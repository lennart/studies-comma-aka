# studies, aka

within the livecoding pattern language tidalcycles, there exists an implementation of the so called bjorklund algorithm (closely related to the euclidian algorithm) creating patterns of a given amount of hits distributed across a certain metric.

while this algorithm allows to create complex rhythmic patterns by entering a tuple of whole numbers in a text editor, some of the creatable rhythms can be retraced back to early persian, caribbean or-as in these studies used-african origins.

in short: two numbers in a text editor represent hundreds of years of cultural heritage

In order to understand the relation between this heritage and plain numbers and to overcome my hesitance to work with this algorithm in performances, I started by picking one of the number pairs, a rhythm necklace used in dances of the aka pygmies in central africa and planned on dissecting this rhythm and possibly field recordings of dances possibly containing this rhythm.

My interest in the aka pygmy music somehow is comprised of the prominent use of repetition, polyrhythm and the use of voices without too much focus on textual content within the singing.

_When_ does cultural identity appear or vanish when livecoding. _how_ does the reduction or addition of elements of the dances create or break the link between a computerized, mechanic, algorithmic version of the rhythm and the acoustically performed one.

I thought about different parameters that could be altered in each study, like speed, in order to document their effects on the material.

and started with the first study, trying to beat match the pure `(11,24.14)` rhythm with a field recording.
